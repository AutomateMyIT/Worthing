# Request Investigation into the decision to cut down 3 prominent trees in the montague centre.
A decision has been made to grant developers the right to cut down 3 trees to make way for a Patisserie Valerie kiosk. The Kiosk is considered to be an important stipulation of the development.

OSG will investigate the reason the Kiosk is considered to be vital. The investigation will focus on spousal connections to Patisserie Valerie and communcations between councillors planners and developers.

Diane Guest,

An investigation request has been submitted to OSG regarding Worthing Councillors' decision permitting developers to remove three trees in the Montague Centre Worthing.

In particular we will be looking at why the Patisserie Valerie kiosk is considered to be of great importance.
The environmental impact of removing the trees.

Little news of the proposal has been reported since 2016 and so we would first ask; are you are aware if the development plans to remove the trees are still going ahead? If so:

As Executive Member for Environment with responsibilities towards Air Quality and Environmental Management, would you be able to provide the details of any research conducted into the adverse affects to air quality, drainage and native wildlife that would be caused by the removal of these trees.

All aspects of our investigation including communications will be made publicly available.

Kind Regards
 
Green Skye Road

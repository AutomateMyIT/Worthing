# Late Night Noise

## Issue
Members affected by late night noise are forced to endure a reduction in sleep for an elongated period while filling in noise diaries for the Environment Agency and waiting for action to be taken.

## Solution Request
Members require a solution that will ensure the noise is stopped within a reasonable time-frame. As the police are unable to take action against nuisance noise it is suggested that the council is put under pressure to change the processes for combating nuisance noise.

## Member Action
Use the Freedom of Information Request method to bring awareness of the problem property. Request details of any communications regarding the property address. Encourage nearby residents to request similar information.
